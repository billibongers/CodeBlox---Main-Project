		Outcome: used
		
	\section{Item Pass Criteria}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The home raspberry pi should be running
			\item The raspberry pi should be connected to the internet
			\item The raspberry should have a connection to the server
		\end{itemize}
		
	\section{Test Deliverables}
	
	\section{Detailed Test Results}
		\subsection{Overview of Test Results}
		All the tests that were carried out passed and meet the expected results. These tests were carried out using the Mocha framework along with an assertion library called Chai.
		
		\subsection{Functional Requirements Test Results}
		Two separate tests were carried out to ensure that everything works. The first set of tests were done over the internet to ensure connection to server and correct communication with the server. The second set of tests, tested the functionality of the individual functions in the module locally. The tests are on Github at :https://github.com/billibongers/CodeBlox---Main-Project/tree/master/Code/Interfaces/tests and https://github.com/billibongers/CodeBlox---Main-Project/tree/master/Code/NodeJs/Services/personModule/test

			The website opened and the video stream started \newline
			Result \newline
			Pass \newline
			
			\subsubsection{Test Case 2 (4.2)}
			New user was added to the system \newline
			server returned status code of 200 \newline
			Result \newline

			\subsubsection{Test Case 3 (4.3)}
			User email was returned \newline
			The data was returned in the correct format \newline
			Result \newline
			Pass \newline
			
			\subsubsection{Test Case 4 (4.4)}
			condition 1 returned active and condition 2 returned inactive \newline
			Result \newline
			Pass \newline
			
			\subsubsection{Test Case 5 (4.5)}

			the pin was returned in the correct format \newline
			pin was linked to correct user \newline
			Result \newline
			Pass \newline
			
			\subsubsection{Test Case 6 (4.6)}
			Condition 1 returned un-used status and condition 2 returned used status \newline
			Result \newline
			Pass \newline

	\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}
	We have gained much insight in terms of testing and its uses. We switched to a testing strategy called Test Driven Development, hereto referred as TTD. With TTD, we are able to write tests without any code written to pass it. This enables the user to write unbiased code because we have no knowledge of the inner code. 
	
	We have also learnt to write tests that test a function in depth. This was achieved by using a special library called chai that is used in conjunction with mocha. It has a vast library of asserts that can be used.
	
	Overall, we are happy with our progress as far as testing is concerned. After completion, if time allows, we wish to carry out a usability test.
