Summary of Research Collected in the week of 10-17 August during my spike to try and get a better understanding of how 
nodejs and the hardware on the pi communicate, i have tested most of the refferences below:

//Node Js based camera kit to make using the camera easier only works locally on  the pi not for streaming

//Live stream to http using applications , this will act similar to the samsung camera but we do have more control over the stream , not based in node js

//Code in nodejs with aditional help for the gate opening system using jonny-five, it also has some other apps that need to be installed to get it to work

https://github.com/fpasteau/raspicam_node                                
//Another node camera base *still needs to be tested

//Basic Streaming using vlc ..... Some extra information in regards to how it works can be found at http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/10564/streaming-live-from-the-picam


Camera can be found on: rtsp://192.168.1.(IP):8554/  with an apromixate 3sec delay wich is less than the samsung camera 5sec delay



Note Need to look into lowsudo aer latency

Used to start vlc feed at start up moved tyhe bash file to /etc/init.d/
sudo cp camfeed.sh /etc/init.d/camfeed.sh
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/camfeed.sh
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/camfeed.sh /etc/rc.d


//Extra this will help with getting a better feed on android https://github.com/spex66/RTSP-Camera-for-Android
