			\subsubsection{Interests}
			I have always been passionate about programming and creating innovative technology that has not been seen before. I enjoy playing cricket, singing and cooking. But most of all I like experimenting with different viruses and finding ways to break code.
			\subsubsection{Technical Skills}
			I am equipped with the knowledge of the following languages and technologies - C++, Java (EE), PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Assembly x64 and MySql/PostGres.
			\subsubsection{Past Experiences}
			I am currently working for the CS department as a tutor for a C++ module, where I create assignments and memos. I was also part of the Integration(High level) team for the Mini Project that we successfully completed this year. I am also currently doing a networking course which I think will be helpful for this project  
			\subsubsection{Non-technical Strengths}
			I have always been a strong candidate for leadership positions, mainly because I am understanding and can find reasonable solutions easily. My communication skills are solid which makes me a strong team player.
			\subsubsection{My motivation for wanting to do this project}
			This is my passion - creating innovative technology. "The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination."

	\section{Project Execution}
	
	\subsection{Development Methodology}  
	
	The Methodology that will be used in this project is the Agile Methodology. We as a group feel like this methodology will be the most faulure and fault proof way to go. In this methodology, we intend to follow the the Spiral process because in this way we can adopt elements from other process models such as waterfall, incremental and evolutionary prototyping.

As a group we decided on the spiral process model because in this project decisions will be made on how to implement the functionality and architecture. With the spiral process model we will choose the safest options that will yield the best results. There is high risk analysis with this process model, and it is the prefered choice for many large and mission critical projects therefore it will suit our project well as it is large too.

The spiral process model also has great features such as the ability to add extra functionality at a later stage in the project. This will porbably be the case as the project progresses, we will most probably add extra functions and helper functions as the project moves along.
