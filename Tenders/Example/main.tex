	\section{Project Execution}
	
	\subsection{Development Methodology}  
	
	The Methodology that will be used in this project is the Agile Development Process. We as a group feel like this methodology will be the most failure and fault proof way to go. In this methodology, we intend to follow the Spiral process because in this way we can adopt elements from other process models such as waterfall, incremental and evolutionary prototyping.

	{\noindent}As a group we decided on the spiral process model because in this project decisions will be made on how to implement the functionality and architecture. With the spiral process model we will choose the safest options that will yield the best results. There is high risk analysis with this process model, and it is the preferred choice for many large and mission critical projects, therefore it will suit our project well.

	{\noindent}The spiral process model also has great features such as the ability to add extra functionality at a later stage in the project. This will probably be the case as the project progresses.
