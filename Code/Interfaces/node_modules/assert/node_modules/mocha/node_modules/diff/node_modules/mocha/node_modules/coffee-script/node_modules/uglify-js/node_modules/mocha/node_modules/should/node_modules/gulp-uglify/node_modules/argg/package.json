It's just three lines of code to `require` pathnames from the command line. Shell globbing test runner, if you will, which you can do when your tests are simple scripts.\n\nusage\n-----\nInstall like:\n\n    npm i argg --save-dev\n\n…then in your package.json add:\n\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"node node_modules/argg tests/*.js\",\n        \"cover\": \"istanbul cover node_modules/argg tests/*.js\"\n    },\n\n…so from the command line, you can run tests and get code coverage with istanbul like:\n\n    npm test\n    npm run cover\n\nwhy\n---\nHey ok, tap has a [nice test runner](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap/blob/master/lib/tap-runner.js), but I would need something [like](https://github.com/substack/tape/pull/19) this for tape by itself, or for either tap or tape with istanbul. I could make a file and explicitly require the files, but that takes typing, and I know I'd miss something.\n\nlicense\n-------\nMIT licensed by permission from my employer. See LICENSE.txt.\n",
