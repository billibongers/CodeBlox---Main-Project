JS-YAML - YAML 1.2 parser and serializer for JavaScript
=======================================================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml.png)](http://travis-ci.org/nodeca/js-yaml)

[Online Demo](http://nodeca.github.com/js-yaml/)


This is an implementation of [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a human friendly data
serialization language. Started as [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) port, it was
completely rewritten from scratch. Now it's very fast, and supports 1.2 spec.


Breaking changes in 1.x.x -> 2.0.x
----------------------------------

If your have not used __custom__ tags or loader classes - no changes needed. Just
upgrade library and enjoy high parse speed.

In other case, you should rewrite your tag constructors and custom loader
classes, to conform new schema-based API. See
[examples](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/tree/master/examples) and
[wiki](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/wiki) for details.
Note, that parser internals were completely rewritten.


Installation
------------

### YAML module for node.js

```
npm install js-yaml
```


### CLI executable

If you want to inspect your YAML files from CLI, install js-yaml globally:

```
npm install js-yaml -g
```

#### Usage

```
usage: js-yaml [-h] [-v] [-c] [-j] [-t] file

Positional arguments:
  file           File with YAML document(s)

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help     Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --version  Show program's version number and exit.
  -c, --compact  Display errors in compact mode
  -j, --to-json  Output a non-funky boring JSON
  -t, --trace    Show stack trace on error
```


### Bundled YAML library for browsers

``` html
<script src="js-yaml.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
var doc = jsyaml.load('greeting: hello\nname: world');
</script>
```

Browser support was done mostly for online demo. If you find any errors - feel
free to send pull requests with fixes. Also note, that IE and other old browsers
needs [es5-shims](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) to operate.


API
---

Here we cover the most 'useful' methods. If you need advanced details (creating
your own tags), see [wiki](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/wiki) and
[examples](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/tree/master/examples) for more
info.

In node.js JS-YAML automatically registers handlers for `.yml` and `.yaml`
files. You can load them just with `require`. That's mostly equivalent to
calling `load()` on fetched content of a file. Just with one string!

``` javascript
require('js-yaml');

// Get document, or throw exception on error
try {
  var doc = require('/home/ixti/example.yml');
  console.log(doc);
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```


### load (string [ , options ])

Parses `string` as single YAML document. Returns a JavaScript object or throws
`YAMLException` on error.

NOTE: This function **does not** understands multi-document sources, it throws
exception on those.

options:

- `filename` _(default: null)_ - string to be used as a file path in
  error/warning messages.
- `strict` _(default - false)_ makes the loader to throw errors instead of
  warnings.
- `schema` _(default: `DEFAULT_SCHEMA`)_ - specifies a schema to use.


### loadAll (string, iterator [ , options ])

Same as `load()`, but understands multi-document sources and apply `iterator` to
each document.

``` javascript
var yaml = require('js-yaml');

yaml.loadAll(data, function (doc) {
  console.log(doc);
});
```


### safeLoad (string [ , options ])

Same as `load()` but uses `SAFE_SCHEMA` by default - only recommended tags of
YAML speci
