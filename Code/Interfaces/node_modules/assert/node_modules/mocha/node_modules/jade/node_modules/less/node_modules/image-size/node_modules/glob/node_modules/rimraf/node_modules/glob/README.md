This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
library to do its matching.

## Usage

Install with npm

```
npm i glob
```

```javascript
var glob = require("glob")

// options is optional
glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
  // files is an array of filenames.
  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
  // er is an error object or null.
})
```

## Glob Primer

"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on
the command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.

Before parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded
into a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any
number of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain
slash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.

The following characters have special magic meaning when used in a
path portion:

* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion
* `?` Match
