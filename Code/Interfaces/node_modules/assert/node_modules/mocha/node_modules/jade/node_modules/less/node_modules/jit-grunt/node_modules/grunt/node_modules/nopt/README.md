If you want to write an option parser, and have it be good, there are
two ways to do it.  The Right Way, and the Wrong Way.

The Wrong Way is to sit down and write an option parser.  We've all done
that.

The Right Way is to write some complex configurable program with so many
options that you go half-insane just trying to manage them all, and put
it off with duct-tape solutions until you see exactly to the core of the
problem, and finally snap and write an awesome option parser.

If you want to write an option parser, don't write an option parser.
Write a package manager, or a source control system, or a service
restarter, or an operating system.  You probably won't end up with a
good one of those, but if you don't give up, and you are relentless and
diligent enough in your procrastination, you may just end up with a very
nice option parser.

## USAGE

    // my-program.js
    var nopt = require("nopt")
      , Stream = require("stream").Stream
      , path = require("path")
      , knownOpts = { "foo" : [String, null]
                    , "bar" : [Stream, Number]
                    , "baz" : path
                    , "bloo" : [ "big", "medium", "small" ]
                    , "flag" : Boolean
                    , "pick" : Boolean
                    , "many" : [String, Array]
                    }
      , shortHands = { "foofoo" : ["--foo", "Mr. Foo"]
                     , "b7" : ["--bar", "7"]
                     , "m" : ["--bloo", "medium"]
                     , "p" : ["--pick"]
                     , "f" : ["--flag"]
                     }
                 // everything is optional.
                 // knownOpts and shorthands default to {}
                 // arg list defaults to process.argv
                 // slice defaults to 2
      , parsed = nopt(knownOpts, shortHands, process.argv, 2)
    console.log(parsed)

This would give you support for any of the following:

```bash
$ node my-program.js --foo "blerp" --no-flag
{ "foo" : "blerp", "flag" : false }

$ node my-program.js ---bar 7 --foo "Mr. Hand" --flag
{ bar: 7, foo: "Mr. Hand", flag: true }

$ node my-program.js --foo "blerp" -f -----p
{ foo: "blerp", flag: true, pick: true }

$ node my-program.js -fp --foofoo
{ foo: "Mr. Foo", flag: true, pick: true }

$ node my-program.js --foofoo -- -fp  # -- stops the flag parsing.
{ foo: "Mr. Foo", argv: { remain: ["-fp"] } }

$ node my-program.js --blatzk 1000 -fp # unknown opts are ok.
{ blatzk: 1000, flag: true, pick: true }

$ node my-program.js --blatzk true -fp # but they need a value
{ blatzk: true, flag: true, pick: true }

$ node my-program.js --no-blatzk -fp # unless they start with "no-"
{ blatzk: false, flag: true, pick: true }

$ node my-program.js --baz b/a/z # known paths are resolved.
{ baz: "/Users/isaacs/b/a/z" }

# if Array is one of the types, then it can take many
# values, and will always be an array.  The other types provided
# specify what types are allowed in the list.

$ node my-program.js --many 1 --many null --many foo
{ many: ["1", "null", "foo"] }

$ node my-program.js --many foo
{ many: ["foo"] }
```

Read the tests at the bottom of `lib/nopt.js` for more examples of
what this puppy can do.

## Types

The following types are supported, and defined on `nopt.typeDefs`

* String: A normal string.  No parsing is done.
* path: A file system path.  Gets resolved against cwd if not absolute.
* url: A url.  If it doesn't parse, it isn't accepted.
* Number: Must be numeric.
* Date: Must parse as a date. If it does, and `Date` is one of the options,
  then it will return a Date object,
