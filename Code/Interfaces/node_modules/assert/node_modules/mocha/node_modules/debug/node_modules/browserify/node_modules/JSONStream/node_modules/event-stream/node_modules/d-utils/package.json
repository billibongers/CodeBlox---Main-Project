  "readme": "#Dominic's Utilities\n\nwriting utilities for doing all the little chores. \n\nthen i'll reuse this everytime and never rewrite the basic stuff.\n\nit's important to abstract and reuse anything that can be.\n\nnot to save you from rewriting the code, but to save you from retesting it.\n\nI may have commited a sin by writing this myselfwhen I could just use underscore,\nbut it is still a great improvement to write an iterator my self just once, \nthan to write it inline every time I need one.",
