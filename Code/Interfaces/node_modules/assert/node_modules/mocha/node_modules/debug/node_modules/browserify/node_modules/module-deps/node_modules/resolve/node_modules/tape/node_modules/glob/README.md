# Glob

Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.

This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
library to do its matching.

## Attention: node-glob users!

The API has changed dramatically between 2.x and 3.x. This library is
now 100% JavaScript, and the integer flags have been replaced with an
options object.

Also, there's an event emitter class, proper tests, and all the other
things you've come to expect from node modules.

And best of all, no compilation!

## Usage

```javascript
var glob = require("glob")

// options is optional
glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
  // files is an array of filenames.
  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
  // er is an error object or null.
})
```

## Features

Please see the [minimatch
documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for more details.

Supports these glob features:

* Brace Expansion
* Extended glob matching
* "Globstar" `**` matching

See:

* `man sh`
* `man bash`
* `man 3 fnmatch`
* `man 5 gitignore`
* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)

## glob(pattern, [options], cb)

* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
* `options` {Object}
* `cb` {Function}
  * `err` {Error | null}
  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern

Perform an asynchronous glob search.

## glob.sync(pattern, [options])

* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched
* `options` {Object}
* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern

Perform a synchronous glob search.

## Class: glob.Glob

Create a Glob object by instanting the `glob.Glob` class.

```javascript
var Glob = require("glob").Glob
var mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)
```

It's an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches
immediately.

### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])

* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for
* `options` {Object}
* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found
  * `err` {Error | null}
  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern

Note that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will
be immediately available on the `g.found` member.

### Properties

* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.
* `options` The options object passed in.
* `error` The error encountered.  When an error is encountered, the
  glob object is in an undefined state, and should be discarded.
* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There
  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but
  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.
* `statCache` Collection of all the stat results the glob search
  performed.
* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible
  values:
  * `false` - Path does not exist
  * `true` - Path exists
  * `1` - Path exists, and is not a directory
  * `2` - Path exists, and is a directory
  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the
    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`

### Events

* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the
  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,
  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches
  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.
* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the matched.
* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever
  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.
* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.

### Methods

* `abort` Stop the search.

### Options

All the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to
Glob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,
or have glob-specific ramifications.

All options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.

All options are added to the glob object, as well.

* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`.
* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted
  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix
  systems, and `C:\` or some such on Windows.)
* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.
  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always
  match dot files.
* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be
  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is
  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.
* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this
  requires additional stat calls.
* `nosort` Don't sort the results.
* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance
  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed
  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.  It will cause
  ELOOP to be triggered one level sooner in the case of cyclical
  symbolic links.
* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered
  when attempting to r
