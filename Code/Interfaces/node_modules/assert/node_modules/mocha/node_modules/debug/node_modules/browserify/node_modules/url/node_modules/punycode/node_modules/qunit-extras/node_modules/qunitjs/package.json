It's used by the jQuery\nproject to test its code and plugins but is capable of testing any generic\nJavaScript code (and even capable of testing JavaScript code on the server-side).\n\nQUnit is especially useful for regression testing: Whenever a bug is reported,\nwrite a test that asserts the existence of that particular bug. Then fix it and\ncommit both. Every time you work on the code again, run the tests. If the bug\ncomes up again - a regression - you'll spot it immediately and know how to fix\nit, because you know what code you just changed.\n\nHaving good unit test coverage makes safe refactoring easy and cheap. You can\nrun the tests after each small refactoring step and always know what change\nbroke something.\n\nQUnit is similar to other unit testing frameworks like JUnit, but makes use of\nthe features JavaScript provides and helps with testing code in the browser, e.g.\nwith its stop/start facilities for testing asynchronous code.\n\nIf you are interested in helping developing QUnit, you are in the right place.\nFor related discussions, visit the\n[QUnit and Testing forum](https://forum.jquery.com/qunit-and-testing).\n\n## Development\n\nTo submit patches, fork the repository, create a branch for the change. Then implement\nthe change, run `npm test` to lint and test it, then commit, push and create a pull request.\n\nInclude some background for the change in the commit message and `Fixes #nnn`, referring\nto the issue number you're addressing.\n\nTo run `npm test`, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), which includes `npm`.\n\n## Releases\n\nUse [jquery-release](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release). The following aren't handled there, do that first:\n\n* Install [git-extras](https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras) and run `git changelog` to update `History.md`. Clean up the changelog, removing merge commits, whitespace cleanups or other irrelevant commits.\n* Run `grunt authors` and add any new authors to AUTHORS.txt\n* Update the version property in `package.json` to have the right -pre version. Not necessary for patch releases.\n\nCommit these:\n\n\tBuild: Prepare @VERSION release, including authors and history update\n\nThen run the script:\n\n\tnode release.js --remote=jquery/qunit\n\nUpdate `jquery/qunitjs.com`, replacing previous versions with new ones:\n\n* pages/index.html\n* resources/*.html\n\nUpdate [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jquery/qunit/releases), use the changelog from `History.md`.\n\nFinally announce on Twitter @qunitjs (add highlights if possible, otherwise a 2nd tweet might do):\n\n\tReleased @VERSION: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/releases/tag/1.17.0\n",
