#Streams to assist testing Streams

writing streams can be difficult, one of the most difficult aspects can be testing them througherly.

that is where stream-tester comes in. 
stream-tester can be used to generate data to exercise your streams.
combine it with [stream-spec](https://github.com/dominictarr/stream-spec)
which will validate your stream's behaviour and you've got a pretty easy test suite.
