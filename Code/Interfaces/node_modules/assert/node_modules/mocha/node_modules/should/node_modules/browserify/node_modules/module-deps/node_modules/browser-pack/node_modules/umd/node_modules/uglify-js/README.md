UglifyJS 2
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.

This page documents the command line utility.  For
[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).
There's also an
[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,
Chrome and probably Safari).

Install
-------

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

From NPM for use as a command line app:

    npm install uglify-js -g

From NPM for programmatic use:

    npm install uglify-js

From Git:

    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git
    cd UglifyJS2
    npm link .

Usage
-----

    uglifyjs [input files] [options]

UglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the
input files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files
in sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the
same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some
variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.

If you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input
files.

If you wish to pass your options before the input files, separate the two with
a double dash to prevent input files being used as option arguments:

    uglifyjs --compress --mangle -- input.js

The available options are:

```
  --source-map                  Specify an output file where to generate source
                                map.
  --source-map-root             The path to the original source to be included
                                in the source map.
  --source-map-url              The path to the source map to be added in //#
                                sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed
                                with --source-map.
  --source-map-include-sources  Pass this flag if you want to include the
                                content of source files in the source map as
                                sourcesContent property.
  --in-source-map               Input source map, useful if you're compressing
                                JS that was generated from some other original
                                code.
  --screw-ie8                   Pass this flag if you don't care about full
                                compliance with Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks
                                (by default UglifyJS will try to be IE-proof).
  --expr                        Parse a single expression, rather than a
                                program (for parsing JSON)
  -p, --prefix                  Skip prefix for original filenames that appear
                                in source maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3
                                directories from file names and ensure they are
                                relative paths. You can also specify -p
                                relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out
                                itself the relative paths between original
                                sources, the source map and the output file.
  -o, --output                  Output file (default STDOUT).
  -b, --beautify                Beautify output/specify output options.
  -m, --mangle                  Mangle names/pass mangler options.
  -r, --reserved                Reserved names to exclude from mangling.
  -c, --compress                Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass
                                options like -c
                                hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with
                                no argument to use the default compression
                                options.
  -d, --define                  Global definitions
  -e, --enclose                 Embed everything in a big function, with a
                                configurable parameter/argument list.
  --comments                    Preserve copyright comments in the output. By
                                default this works like Google Closure, keeping
                                JSDoc-style comments that contain "@license" or
                                "@preserve". You can optionally pass one of the
                                following arguments to this flag:
                                - "all" to keep all comments
                                - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a
                                slash) to keep only comments that match.
                                Note that currently not *all* comments can be
                                kept when compression is on, because of dead
                                code removal or cascading statements into
                                sequences.
  --preamble                    Preamble to prepend to the output.  You can use
                                this to insert a comment, for example for
                                licensing information.  This will not be
                                parsed, but the source map will adjust for its
                                presence.
  --stats                       Display operations run time on STDERR.
  --acorn                       Use Acorn for parsing.
  --spidermonkey                Assume input files are SpiderMonkey AST format
                                (as JSON).
  --self                        Build itself (UglifyJS2) as a library (implies
                                --wrap=UglifyJS --export-all)
  --wrap                        Embed everything in a big function, making the
                                “exports” and “global” variables available. You
                                need to pass an argument to this option to
                                specify the name that your module will take
                                when included in, say, a browser.
  --export-all                  Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to
                                add code to automatically export all globals.
  --lint                        Display some scope warnings
  -v, --verbose                 Verbose
  -V, --version                 Print version number and exit.
  --noerr                       Don't throw an error for unknown options in -c,
                                -b or -m.
  --bare-returns                Allow return outside of functions.  Useful when
                                minifying CommonJS modules.
  --keep-fnames                 Do not mangle/drop function names.  Useful for
                                code relying on Function.prototype.name.
  --reserved-file               File containing reserved names
  --reserve-domprops            Make (most?) DOM properties reserved for
                                --mangle-props
  --mangle-props                Mangle property names
  --mangle-regex                Only mangle property names matching the regex
  --name-cache                  File to hold mangled names mappings
```

Specify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output
goes to STDOUT.

## Source map options

UglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for
debugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass
`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the
source map dumped).

Additionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the
original files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input
files to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of
directories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source
map.

For example:

    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \
             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \
             -o foo.min.js \
             --source-map foo.min.js.map \
             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \
             -p 5 -c -m

The above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the
output in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source
mapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and
`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`
as the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and
`js/file2.js`).

### Composed source map

When you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as
CoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd
like to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an
option to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from
CoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →
compressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original
location.

To use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map
/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point
to the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit
input files from the command line.

## Mangler options

To enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following
(comma-separated) options are supported:

- `sort` — to assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This
  saves a few hundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is
  _bigger_ after gzip (and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it
  on) therefore it's not enabled by default.

- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by
  default).

- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `with` are used
  (disabled by default).

When mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being
mangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a
comma-separated list of names.  For example:

    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'

to prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.

### Mangling property names (`--mangle-props`)

**Note:** this will probably break your code.  Mangling property names is a
separate step, different from variable name mangling.  Pass
`--mangle-props`.  It will mangle all properties that are seen in some
object literal, or that are assigned to.  For example:

```js
var x = {
  foo: 1
};

x.bar = 2;
x["baz"] = 3;
x[condition ? "moo" : "boo"] = 4;
console.log(x.something());
```

In the above code, `foo`, `bar`, `baz`, `moo` and `boo` will be replaced
with single characters, while `something()` will be left as is.

In order for this to be of any use, we should avoid mangling standard JS
names.  For instance, if your code would contain `x.length = 10`, then
`length` becomes a candidate for mangling and it will be mangled throughout
the code, regardless if it's being used as part of your own objects or
accessing an array's length.  To avoid that, you can use `--reserved-file`
to pass a filename that should contain the names to be excluded from
mangling.  This file can be used both for excluding variable names and
property names.  It could look like this, for example:

```js
{
  "vars": [ "define", "require", ... ],
  "props": [ "length", "prototype", ... ]
}
```

`--reserved-file` can be an array of file names (either a single
comma-separated argument, or you can pass multiple `--reserved-file`
arguments) — in this case it will exclude names from all those files.

A default exclusion file is provided in `tools/domprops.json` which should
cover most standard JS and DOM properties defined in various browsers.  Pass
`--reserve-domprops` to read that in.

You can also use a regular expression to define which property names should be
mangled.  For example, `--mangle-regex="/^_/"` will only mangle property names
that start with an underscore.

When you compress multiple files using this option, in order for them to
work together in the end we need to ensure somehow that one property gets
mangled to the same name in all of them.  For this, pass `--name-cache
filename.json` and UglifyJS will maintain these mappings in a file which can
then be reused.  It should be initially empty.  Example:

```
rm -f /tmp/cache.json  # start fresh
uglifyjs file1.js file2.js --mangle-props --name-cache /tmp/cache.json -o part1.js
uglifyjs file3.js file4.js --mangle-props --name-cache /tmp/cache.json -o part2.js
```

Now, `part1.js` and `part2.js` will be consistent with each other in terms
of mangled property names.

Using the name cache is not necessary if you compress all your files in a
single call to UglifyJS.

## Compressor options

You need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally
you can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form
`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want
to set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).

- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator

- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for
  example `foo["bar"] → foo.bar`

- `dead_code` -- remove unreachable code

- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements

- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply "unsafe" transformations (discussion below)

- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional
  expressions

- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:
  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,
  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.

- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions

- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a
  ? b : c → a ? b : c`

- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can
  statically determine the condition

- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables

- `hoist_funs` -- hoist function declarations

- `hoist_vars` (default: false) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`
  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)

- `if_return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue

- `join_vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements

- `cascade`
